# Traffic_Sign_Recognition
<h3>It is a model to recognize traffic signs. It can recognize 43 different signs like Speed limit (20km/h), Speed limit (30km/h)
, Right-of-way at the next intersection, Pedestrians, Children crossing etc.</h3> 
<h4>I used ResNet50 pre-trained model to train this model. I also tried VGG16 pre-trained model but it's accuracy was not good.</h4>
